Overall
This paper proposes a multi-level heterogeneous knowledge-aware network (HKN）that integrates the information of the text layer, entity layer, and event layer to achieve fine-grained Chinese similar legal cases retrieval. Experiments show that HKN can utilize knowledge to effectively encode the latent semantic features of legal texts and achieve accurate similar legal case retrieval results.

W1: The experimental conditions are a little vague. Since the author has set separate hyperparameters and optimization strategies for each sub-module, what are the hyperparameters set? What optimization has been done? Is it necessary to explain?
W2: The article mentioned that the research content and results are also applicable to similar legal case retrieval tasks in the legal system of other languages or other jurisdictions, but the article did not test cases written in languages other than Chinese.
W3: HKN in some scenes although there is an improvement, but the improvement effect is not obvious.

S1: In a similar legal case retrieval task，cases of the same crime, the author's method can also distinguish well between them in terms of similarity.
S2: The author not only considered discrete knowledge at the entity level but also  considered higher-level event knowledge.
S3: In a variety of scenarios，the HKN model is superior to the baseline model.
